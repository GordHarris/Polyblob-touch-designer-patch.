README - Polyblob

My code-along version of
Ben Voight's Youtube tourial
"Introduction to Touch Designer"
from the Touch Designer Summit
Berlin 2018 - thank you Ben!

This is a large messy network showing
a number of techniques and operators.
Formatted for double HD monitor setup
of 3840x1080 in container1.

Wave your hands in front of webcam and
play with sliders 4 and 5  and toggles 1 and 2.

For blob control use sliders 1-3 and toggles 3 +4.

No good user controls out front.  So
you have to go into project1 or blobby_sphere1
for parameter control, or use touch OSC on 
iphone on simple layout 1, screen1 controlling stuff
wirelessly on same network as computer.

This is just to demonstrate the potential
of OSC control of on screen animations in
FreeDome or elsewhere.
